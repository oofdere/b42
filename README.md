# Broadcasting 42: Intro to Independent Broadcasting and Media Conquest techniques
Welcome to Broadcasting 42, my introduction to the enterprises of broadcasting and the media industry.

## Prerequisites
Depends entirely on the parts of the course you are doing. You should be able to use a computer well enough to make your way to this webpage on your own, and should have a decently modern computer. You're on your own if technical issues arise, as you would be on the field.

The big thing is that you must enjoy media and either want to make some yourself or aid in its creation in some capacity.
## Scope of the course
The idea is to expand the course over time, so there is no scope which is set in stone. The idea is to make several units which can be taken either on their own or as part of the larger package which is B42. The planned units are as follows:
 - B42: The Basics (this will be the very last unit made)
 - B42DV: Digital Video (adapted from [Digital Video Introduction](https://github.com/leandromoreira/digital_video_introduction))
 - B42DA: Digital Audio
 - B42BS: Dr. Mickey or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Ignore the Trends (The Sins of The Industry)
 - B42RT: Real-Time Production
 - B42TV: Television Production
 - B42LS: Live-Stream Production
 - B42RM: Remote Production Workshop
 - B42FM: Radio Production Workshop (Start one from scratch!)
 - B42CP: Heretical Content Licensing (CC, Copyleft, Fair Use, etc.)
 - B42CC: Accessibility (Captions, Subtitles, Audio Description, reducing the burden, and why it matters)
 - B42CS: Computing for the Indie (Linux, Self-hosting, Docker, git/GitHub, HTML, scripting, FFmpeg, etc.)
 - B42AI: The Potential of Artificial Intelligence in Media
 - B42ED: Non-linear Video Editing
 - B42FX: Open Source Visual Effects (Blender, Natron, etc.)
 - B42HS: History of Independent Broadcasting
 - B42SM: Smuggling your content into countries that ban it
 - B42DD: Due Diligence
 - B42CD: Putting content on discs
 - B42NO: Monetization
 - B42SD: Distribution
There are not ordered in any capacity yet.

## Credits
**Scott Merrifield**, whose wonderful Intro to Television Production course really brought me into this field and is the main inspiration for this course.

The [**Harvard CS50**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) and [**MIT 18.S191**](https://github.com/mitmath/18S191) teams, whose excellent and open-source online courses inspired this.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### When can I take this course?
Statistically, never.

### Why should I trust you?
You shouldn't.

### Is there a certificate?
Yes! It's called proving your knowledge by actually doing things.

Several of the units are workshops where you'll end up with a unique product, but it's up to you to make them age well. If you do the Radio Production Workshop, keep your radio station running, for instance. Consistency is the most important thing for a broadcaster to demonstrate.

### What is the license?
Unsure for now, but rest assured that the content will remain libre. I'll probably adopt a Free Culture License.
